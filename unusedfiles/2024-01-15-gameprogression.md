Progression in videogames is mainly marked through 3 different aspects. Either the player achieves some milestone, possibly marked through an achievement, they undergo a skill breakthrough, where there skill as a player reaches new heights, or most commonly, their character gets stronger.

While the other two forms of progression are equally rewarding in their own right, upgrading your character to perform better and become stronger is a tried and true method of progression.

<br />
<br />
<h1 class="secondHeader" >How do I progress?</h1>
_____________________________________________________
The most common way of "power" progression is upgrading your character, usually in the form of a currency. *Pokemon* does this through XP, or expierence where, over the course of many battles, the pokemon levels up, potentially evolving in the process and achieving better stats.

*Destiny 2* progression comes in the form of new more powerful gear, with a bigger number.

While these are all unique way to progress, mobile games have the simpliest form of "power" progression. It's as follows.

```
Pay => Stronger
```
ðŸ˜€
<br />
Simple, right?
<br />
<br>
Let's back up. "Pay" doesn't mean you have to fork over real cash (but that's still an option). "Pay" just means you must exchange some form of currency in order to get something in return.
<br />
<br>
For example, 20 coins in order to upgrade your fighter to level 2, which then means they recieve a +5 attack buff.
<br />
<br>
Ok ok, if you're a gamer you probably already know all this stuff and are wondering when it gets good. Well, it's about to get good.
<br>
I want to zoom in on a particular mobile game, and look it's progression, and that mobile game is *Brawl Stars*. *Brawl Stars* is a top down, multiplayer "brawler", full of magic, superpowers and bullets.
<br>
<br>
As a player of the game myself, I quite like the fast gameplay, and unique kits each brawler brings to the battle. Of course, in order to win more, you have to upgrade your brawlers, which you can do with power points, and coins, the two main currencies. 
<br>
<br>
Coins can be used to buy star powers, gears, and gadgets, which function as either stat boosts or enhance the brawlers kit, while powerpoints, in combination with coins, are used to upgrade the brawler all the way to level 11, receiving a stat boost each time they level up. 
<br>
<br>
If I asked you how you would get Coins and Powerpoints, you would probably say through win battles. Well, not exactly. When you win a battle in brawl stars, your rewards are...

* Trophies
* Mastery Points
* Battle XP

Hmm... coins and Power Points dont' seem to be on there...
_________________________________________________________

<h1 class="secondHeader"> Well, how do I get coins and Power Points then? </h1>

<br>
<br>

I'm glad you asked! Let's not get ahead of ourselves though, trophies, xp and mastery points are all still useful.
<br>
<br>
Trophies contribute to Trophy Road, a reward-rich path full of coins and Power Points!

<br />
145 coins and 40 Power points? According to the Brawl Stars Wiki, you need 4965 coins and 2300 Power Points to upgrade a brawler to power 9, the generally accepted "playable" level, where the brawler will perform well, partly due to their gadgets and star powers being unlocked.
<br>
<br>
Doing some quick calculations we can see...
<br>
<br>
In order to get from 40 Power Points to 145 coins, you need to get 200 trophies.  
One solo showdown game WIN, is around 10 trophies. Assuming you're a gaming legend, and you win every game in around 3 minutes, it would take 20 wins, or 60 minutes / 1 hour for you to get 145 coins/40 Power Points/25 credits. For simplicity's sake, let's average everything out to 50 Power Points, 50 credits and 150 coins.

*A brief note here: My calculations did not take into account win streaks, which provide a decent snowballing effect on trophies, but the point made on trophy road still stands; it's rewards are pretty lack luster for the effort needed.*

<h1 class="secondHeader">That does not sound good...</h1>  
<br>
Does that mean you have to live, eat, sleep and poop *Brawl Stars* for around 100 days to get the needed currency? Well not exactly.  
There are, of course other ways to get these currencies.
<br>
<br>

*An important note here is that to upgrade a brawler you need both Power Points AND coins, and coins are already used in so many places that you'll often have a bountiful supply of Power Points but be broke in coins.*

<br>
<br>
<div id="creditTangent">
<h1 class="secondHeader">Credits</h1>
But wait!, I hear you say. What about credits? Well, to unlock a mythic brawler you need 1900 credits. 1900/50 = 38 times. If you need 200 trophies to get to the next 50 credits, you would need 7600 trophies total. I don't even need to do the math to tell you how bad that sounds.

So far, we've been doing *Brawl Stars* really dirty. The game progression *seems* terrible because we are only focusing on one aspect. Let's zoom out really quick.

Other than trophy road, there are two main ways to get progression related items and currency:  
The Brawl Pass  
Brawl Stars  
<br>
The word "Pass" probably lit up a "monkey go brrr" switch in the brain of all you gamer's out there, the word "pass" is enough to send many gamers into a frenzy. The Brawl Pass is nothing revolutionary, but as cliche as a battle pass is, it is a decent progression mechanic.  
Each tier need 950 xp, and a f2p player, who is on the free tier, has access to around 4 quests, 2 500 xp quests, and 2 400 xp quests. That's 1800 xp, just a bit shy of 2 tiers, but lets be nice and round up to 2.  
<br>
<br>
Well, we have completed 2 tiers! What would our rewards be? Let's look at the most recent Brawl Pass (as of the time of writing), Season 22, featuring some really unique looking skins!

<style>
    img[alt=brawlPass]{width:70vw;height:auto;}
</style>

<br>
Heyyyy now we're talking, a lump sum of coins and credits, as well as lots of brawl stars! This isn't terrible, but it still does take some time, considering you are locked out of progressing after your 4 quests are done. You can get xp from battles, but the total amount you can get for the day is 200, not even 1/4 of a tier.  
<br>
<br>
1000 coins is enough to buy a gadget, and is a decent enough sum where it makes some difference. The 100 credits, is alright, but considering that it contributes to getting a new brawler, any amount is enough.
<br>
<br>
Another thing to note is that you also get 1000 power points a few times, which is HUGE and great for progressions, but this actually gets bottlenecked as we'll see later...
<br>
<br>
<h1 class="secondHeader">But what about the Brawl Stars?</h1>
You're right! What's the value of the Brawl Stars? Well, we don't exactly know, because get this, its RANDOM! Any sort of RNG gets gamers frothing at the mouth, for just the taste of what they COULD get, if they get another, another and another chance.  
RNG is great. Really. It adds a fun and exciting mechanic that spices up gameplay, and rewards, while still giving SOMETHING in return.  
Let's look at Star Drop rates. Hold on to your friendly Buzz, we're taking a deep dive here, and there's going to be alot of math.  
<br>
<br>
<h1 class="secondHeader"> Math math and more Power Points</h1>
According to the Brawl Stars Wiki, a Star Drop has a 50% chance of being rare, 28% chance of being Super Rare, a 15% chance of being Epic, 5% chance of being Mythic and a 2% chance of being legendary.  
*It's at this point, I realized that "star drop" was actually spelled "starr drop", but I'm too lazy to change it, so deal with it.*  
<br>
<br>
One quick google slides assembly later...

</style>

<script>
   function setImageVisible(id, visible) {
    var img = document.getElementById(id);
    img.style.visibility = (visible ? 'visible' : 'hidden');
}
</script>
*My apologies for mobile screen users*  
<br>
<br>
Ok let's dissect this. There's alot to see here, but let's only focus on the important bits.  
A rare drop is a 50% chance, and the most common items are 50 coins, at around 40%, 25 Power Points at 33% and 100 XP Doublers at 21%. These are all chump change. They are so insignificant in the progression they provide.  
Additionally, thats practically all the drop would give you, as the other 5 percent is credits and bling (cosmetic currency), and with only a 5% chance, good luck getting that 20 bling.  
Ok well, we still have other drop rarities. A super rare drop has around a 1/3 chance, which isn't terrible. Let's see what we can get.

![superraredrop](/assets/images/blog/2024-01-15/superrare.webp)
<style>
    img[alt=superraredrop]{width:70vw;height:auto;}
</style>
Right of the bat, theres a 42% chance for 100 coins and 33% chance for 50 power points, both of which aren't super significant, but better than nothing. However, that occupies 75% of the drop. So even if you manage to break past 50% and land on super rare, you're probably just gonna get some more coins.  
However the super rare drop does give us a taste on whats to come. There's a 3.31% for a common pin and a 1.32% chance for a spray. What are those? Sweet, sweet cosmetics.  
<br>
<br>
Well you've been saving up your luck and have managed to get an epic drop! Nice! Let's see what's in it!
<br>
![epicdrop](/assets/images/blog/2024-01-15/epic.png)
<style>
    img[alt=epicdrop]{width:10vw;height:auto;}
</style>
<br>
<br>
Ok, ok more resources, occupying 42% of the drop. Oh! Look at all those cosmetics! 16% common pin, 16% spray, and 15% total for rare cosmetics. Don't get me wrong, I love cosmetics, but getting pins, sprays and cosmetics, that are incredibly cheap, in a progression reward? They aren't exactly making me stronger are they...  
The epic was a bit of a let down but now we're moving onto the juicy drops, mythic and legendary.
<br>
<br>
I guess you're on Lady Luck's good side if you got all the way to a mythic! Let's crack it open!  
Ok, lots of variety here, which is usually a good sign. Before we look at the rewards individually, lets tally up the cosmetic chances vs. tangible progression.  
And the results are 62.02% tangible progression, in the forms of lump sums of Power Points, coins, gadgets, and brawlers of the super rare, epic, and if you're lucky, a mythic brawler.  
This is all fine and dandy at the surface but there's a few problems here. First, the gadget. Gadget's are specific to a brawler, and each brawler has 2 options,so you could get a gadget for a brawler you never use, or it could be really really bad. But gadgets are 1000 coins, so it's not terrible math wise? I guess not, but gameplay wise it sure is.
<br>
<br>
With only a 5% chance of getting to a mythic, getting a useless gadget sure is going to demoralize you. Getting a brawler however, is generally a win, no matter the rarity, as credits are hard to come by, and there is a fixed order in which you have to unlock them, with a bit of wiggle room here and there. The brawler's only make up 16% however, and sooner or later, you'll unlock all the super rare and most of the epic brawlers, leaving only a 2% chance for a mythic.
<br>
<br>
And the pins, profile icons and sprays? Yeah, you're never using those, practically useless. A rare skin? Well, better than no skin right? Wrong, most rare skins are recolors and look HORRENDOUS. But, a skin's a skin.
<br>
<br>
Ok, we've reached the end. If you got to a legendary drop, Lady Luck must of owed *you* a favor. 2% chance, lets make it count.  
Drum roll please.
Super rare skin at 36%, star power at 27%, 16% hypercharge, 15% for epic, mythic and legendary brawlers, and 2.17 for an epic skin. This does not seem terrible except for the super rare skin. A Super rare skin???
A super rare skin is 2750 bling!
<br>
<br>
<h1 class="secondHeader">Drown in the Drip</h1>
Let's take a detour and calculate cost of bling. In the shop, a 2750 bling super rare skin is also sold for 69 gems. It states that its a discount from 79, but its pretty obvious that it's a advertisement technique to make us think its a good deal. That puts 1 gem = to around 40 bling.  
Gem's are hard to come by, but their value has crashed because, in a questionable decision by Supercell, you cannot buy the brawl pass for gems anymore. You used to be able to buy it for 169 gems, and, in all honesty, it was massive value. You still had to grind all the way to the end, but you got a HUGE amount of coins, power points, chroma credits (since removed, used to be for unlocking chromatic brawlers), and you got 5000 bling at the start, enough for an epic skin AND the newest brawler PLUS a epic tier or higher skin for them.  
<br>
<br>
Now, it costs real money, and gems are really only used for skins, and maybe speeding up unlocking a brawler both of which are a waste, as you can use bling to get skins and credits come slowly enough.  
The Brawl Stars wiki goes through gem uses, and really most of it was cosmetic in nature. Both bling and gems are hard to come by, as bling really only comes in large amounts through the *paid* pass. You can get it in Power league but Power League is HYPER competiteve, just to grind one rank for 125 bling (The main attraction is the exclusive skin, but you don't even get it for free, you have to purchase it with your non-existent bling).  
<br>
<br>
All of this makes to make the point that skins are insanely difficult to get, as the currency needed for them is incredibly hard to acquire, spread so thinly through the brawl star world.  
Gems have pretty much exited relevancy with them being identical to bling now in the things that they can do. There are 299 gem skins, only avaible for gems, that admittedly, look so cool, which is really the only use for gems now. GG gems, you had a good run.

<h1 class="secondHeader">So does that mean getting skins in legendaries is good?</h1>
Aaah, not quite. Our conclusion was that skins are insanely difficult to get, but since the currency used to get them are also difficult to get and have no other use, its not absolutely terrible, but it will take some time. The reason why putting them in a legendary, mythic and epic drop is an issue is that these drops are for PROGRESSION. Cosmetics contribute nothing to progression. Considering how scarce resources are everywhere else, the only reliable place to get progression resources is Starr Drops, but these drops are full of cosmetics that are useless to progression, can be aquired elsewhere, and have their own set of problems.

<h1 class="secondHeader">The conclusion? Ruh Roh</h1>
Ruh roh is right. Starr Drops most of the time will give you chump change, and don't hold your breath if you get a high rarity drop, you're probably just going to get a cosmetic that you'll never use. This wouldn't be as much as a problem if Starr Drops weren't the only main form of aquiring progression resources. In recent updates, Starr Drops have been thrown at us more than explosives in a dynamike hypercharge. Every other reward on the pass is a star drop, you can get 3 drops a day for winning battles, the trophy road is chock full of drops, and now even the christmas brawlidays is not safe from the starrdropocalypse.
<br>
<br>
The rewards are just not worth it. Once u win 10 battles to get your 3 drops, complete your quests, your play time is not rewarded, which is reasonable for a mobile game in some regard. The progression system is non rewarding in the slightest, with the main rng mechanic fundamentally unrewarding, and coupled with a coin depression in the current economy, something needs to be fixed.
<br>
<br>
There's alot I did not cover, but this topic is so vast, and with the post already being so long, its fitting to end it here.
<br>

Until we meet again Dear Reader,
